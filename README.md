## 🔒 My Approach to Collaboration & Private Repositories

I have a strong preference for developing projects in private repositories. Over 98% of my work, including my most valued projects involving automation and social media API integration, is kept private to protect the core ideas and intellectual property.

I am passionate about building innovative tools and I am open to collaboration with like-minded individuals. If you are interested in working together on unique and serious projects, please feel free to reach out. Once we establish a foundation of trust and mutual respect, we can collaborate effectively within a shared private repository.

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m open to working with others who are:

*   Respectful
*   Willing to teach and learn together
*   Focused on building real features, not ego

If we connect well and trust is built,
✅ **I am open to collaborating using a PRIVATE repository**
so we can work freely, safely, and seriously.
